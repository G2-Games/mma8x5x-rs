//! ## The devices
//!
//! The MMA8653FC is an intelligent, low-power, three-axis, capacitive micromachined accelerometer
//! with 10 bits of resolution. This accelerometer is packed with embedded functions with flexible
//! user-programmable options, configurable to two interrupt pins. Embedded interrupt functions
//! enable overall power savings, by relieving the host processor from continuously polling data.
//! There is access to either low-pass or high-pass filtered data, which minimizes the data
//! analysis required for jolt detection and faster transitions. The device can be configured to
//! generate inertial wake-up interrupt signals from any combination of the configurable embedded
//! functions, enabling the MMA8653FC to monitor inertial events while remaining in a low-power
//! mode during periods of inactivity.

//! ## Usage examples (see also examples folder)

//! To use this driver, import this crate and an `embedded_hal` implementation,
